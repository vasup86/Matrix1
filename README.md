# Matrix1

Matrix solving app creating in Android Studio using Java. The app uses phone camera to scan image (matrix) and solves it in Reduced Row-Echelon Form (RREF). The app uses google firebase ml to convert image to text, but unfortunately the translation from image to text is not good enough to be processed, so the rest of the system is to be developed.
